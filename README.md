# Lunar Client IntelliJ Plugin

Decompiling this was a pain in the ass.

To compare, I decompiled the original version versus the decompiled code of this project.

Most of the `TODO()` calls or `// TODO:` comments are stuff that doesnt match up with the decompiled code.

This also uses an outdated version of the Lunar Client plugin.

This decomp is pretty much pointless unless if you want to reference it when making your own IntelliJ plugin.

*P.S.: I believe this code is specific to a specific version of IntelliJ.*
